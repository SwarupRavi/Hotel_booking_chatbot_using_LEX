# Hotel booking chatbot using AWS LEX,AWS lambda and python

Chatbot was done using the help of AWS LEX using AWS console.
Various slots,intents and slot types were added..

AWS Lambda is used here and a small snippet of .py code is used here.

validate.py has the slot validation code which is integrated with aws lambda

Python was used here to just validate if the chatbot responses and the intents are working fine or not.


Post that,the chatbot has been integrated with Kommunicate,a website that creates an UI for the bot.
